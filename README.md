# UX Portfolio

Hey! I'm Dylan Hall
I'm a computer scientist that has a passion for machine learning, specifically neural networks. I think the idea of trying to replicate the human brain is facinating and I see a lot of potential for progress. After college, I want to go into reseach and development for prosthetics and I'm hoping that neural networks can bring us closer to the goal of replicating the intended movement of the user based on the information available to us given the state of the user.
